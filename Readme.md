# Pending Tasks:

+ Dependency Injection: Koin, Kodein ?Â¿
+ Logging DEBUG vs RELEASE: Obfuscate relevant information
+ Libraries versions: Unify versions on a single file
+ Firebase Integration
+ Unit Testing
+ Coverage Tools
+ Publish Artifact
+ Bluetooth Integration
+ Automation Testing



# Successful milestones:

+ Module Abstraction. A common module has been created which the rest of modules inject. All the business logic has been splitted in several modules such as launches (All information regarding SpaceX launches). A shared module has been created as a bridge with all feature modules.
+ REST Request: Using Ktor a GET request to a public API and retrieve data on both platforms was executed successfully.
+ Logging REST: Using Ktor-logging to show logs on the console was executed successfully.
+ Logging messages: Local implementation was required. Logs not disabled on iOS Release.
+ Coroutines Retries: Custom implementation has been done to retry failing REST connections.
+ Exception Handler: Custom implementation has been created to ensure only CustomException is sent to domain layer.



# Issues found:

### Logging messages:
There no native logging mechanism. Actual/Expect implementation was required. Logs not disabled on iOS Release.


### CustomException on Domain Layer:
The only way to populate to domain layer Custom Exception was adding @ExperimentalStdlibApi to all classes propagating the Exception. Review in the future the compatibility.
